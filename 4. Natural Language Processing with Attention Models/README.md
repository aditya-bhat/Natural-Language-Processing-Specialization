# Course 4. Natural Language Processing with Attention Models

In Course 4 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai (https://www.coursera.org/learn/attention-models-in-nlp), you will:

a) Translate complete English sentences into French using an encoder-decoder attention model,
b) Build a Transformer model to summarize text,
c) Use T5 and BERT models to perform question-answering, and
d) Build a chatbot using a Reformer model.

Please make sure that you’ve completed Course 3.

By the end of this Specialization, you will have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, created tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even built a chatbot!

This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. Łukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.
